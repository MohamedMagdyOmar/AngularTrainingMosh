in this section:
1- implement forms with different kinds of input fields
2- display validation errors
3- disable the submit button.

-ngModel:
- now we need to add validation to the form we have created using template driven approach.
- so in "template driven" we apply a "directive" to the "input" field, and angular
will create a "control object" associated with this "input field".
- this directive is "ngModel"
