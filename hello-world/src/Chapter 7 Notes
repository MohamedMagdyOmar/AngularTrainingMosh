in this section:
1- implement forms with different kinds of input fields
2- display validation errors
3- disable the submit button.

-ngModel:
- now we need to add validation to the form we have created using template driven approach.
- so in "template driven" we apply a "directive" to the "input" field, and angular
will create a "control object" associated with this "input field".
- this directive is "ngModel".

-ngForm:
- when we used "ngModel" we found that angular creates "formControl" under the hood, and 
we see that after we passed the varia
- we have also in angular another control called "FormGroup" that have multiple forms

- in previous example <form></form>, angular by default creates "ngform", check the exampleto see how angular creates for you
ngform automatically. also ngForm exposes "outputs" (check angular doc) that can be used as event binding.
